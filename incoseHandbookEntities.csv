This information is intended to help build an understanding of the environment for which the solution is needed in order to estab-lish better insight into the stakeholder concerns.
– In particular, analyze the system requirements and tag nonfunctional requirements, that is, those dealing with operational conditions (e.g., safety, security, dependability, human factors, simplicity of interfaces, environmental conditions), as well as life cycle constraints (e.g., maintenance, disposal, deployment) that will strongly influence the definition of the solution elements.
– Capture stakeholder concerns related to architecture. Usually, the stakeholder concerns focus on expectations or constraints that span one or more system life cycle stages. The concerns are often related to critical quality characteristics to the system that relate to those stages.
– Establish the approach for defining the architecture. This includes an architecture roadmap and strategy, as well as methods, modeling techniques, tools, and the need for any enabling sys-tems, products, or services.

– In conjunction with the system requirements definition process, determine the system con-text (i.e., how the SOI fits into the external environment) and boundary, including the interfaces, that reflect the operational scenarios and expected system behaviors. This task includes identification of expected interactions of the system with systems or other entities external to the system (control) boundary as defined in negotiated ICDs.
– Determine which architectural entities (e.g., functions, input/output flows, system elements, physical interfaces, architectural characteristics, information/data elements, containers, nodes, links, communication resources, etc.) address the highest priority requirements (i.e., most important stakeholder concerns, critical quality characteristics, and other critical needs).
– Allocate concepts, properties, characteristics, behaviors, functions, and/or constraints that are significant to architecture decisions of the system to architectural entities.
– Select, adapt, or develop models of the candidate architectures of the system, such as logical and physical models. It is sometimes neither necessary nor sufficient to use logical and physical models. The models to be used are those that best address key stakeholder concerns. Logical models may include functional, behavioral, or temporal models; physical models may include structural blocks, mass, layout, and other physical models (see Section 9.1 for more information about models).
– Determine need for derived system requirements induced by necessary added architectural entities (e.g., functions, interfaces) and by structural dispositions (e.g., constraints, operational conditions). Use the system requirements definition process to define and formalize them.
– Compose views from the models of the candidate architectures. The views are intended to ensure that the stakeholder concerns and critical require-ments have been addressed.
– For each system element that composes the system, develop requirements corresponding to allocation, alignment, and partitioning of archi-tectural entities and system requirements to system elements. To do this, invoke the stakeholder needs and requirements definition process and the system requirements definition process.
– Analyze the architecture models and views for consistency and resolve any issues identified. Correspondence rules from frameworks can be useful in this analysis (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010, 2011).
– Verify and validate the models by execution or simulation, if modeling techniques and tools permit, and with traceability matrix of OpsCon. Where possible, use design tools to check their feasibility and validity. As needed, implement partial mock‐ups or prototypes, or use executable architecture prototypes or simulators.",64,4.4
4CF62FA6-2E8A-40AB-BD5F-C57856872A36,Activity,Relate the architecture to design,"– Determine the system elements that reflect the architectural entities. Since the architecture is intended to be design‐agnostic, these system elements may be notional until the design evolves. To do this, partition, align, and allocate architec-tural entities and system requirements to system elements. Establish guiding principles for the system design and evolution. Sometimes, a “reference architecture” is created using these notional system elements as a means to convey architectural intent and to check for design feasibility.
– Establish allocation matrices between architec-tural entities using their relationships.
